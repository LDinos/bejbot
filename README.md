# Running the bot
- You need an auth.json file that uses the bot authentication code which is hidden in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page of your application. 
```json
{
"token": "<put your token here>"
}
```
- You install the dependencies ```node install```
- If 'canvas' brings an error, please follow the instructions in https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas. 
TLDR; Run the command in the 'Compiling' section, then ```npm install --build-from-source```
- You run the bot by typing ```node bot```
- You need textures for command ```+board_image``` to work by creating a folder in ```Bot_modules/textures/``` and inserting png textures of the gems (64x64) depending on the colors and their power . For example, a green gem must be in a ```g.png``` file in the textures folder. A green flame gem must be ```gf.png```. A lightning green gem must be ```gl.png``` and a green Supernova is ```gs.png```. 
- You also need a ```Bot_modules/textures/board.png``` (512x512) for the board in the background.

# Code Structure
- ```bot.js```: The main code of the bot. Holds all commands and their behaviour
- ```emoji_table.js```: A list of character strings that are read from the user when using command ```+board``` that get converted to an emoji string so that emojis are visible in the final message
- ```letter_table.js```: Similarly, the same happens with letters when using the ```+say``` command. Each character is converted to an emoji using this file
- ```imagecreator.js```: Code that creates an image depending on what the user wrote in ```+board_image``` command.
- ```board_template.json```: A template game structure for when starting a game with ```+start_game```. Each channel has its own game
- ```emoji_help```: Help string for a discord user when using ```+board```
- ```help_table```: List of all commands for a discord user that used ```+help```
